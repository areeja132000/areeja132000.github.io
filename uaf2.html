        <p></p>
        <p>First, I ran checksec and determined that all security measures were enabled. Therefore, I could not use that to my advantage. I inspected the code and came up with the following exploit. First, I allocated a large space in memory. Then, I deleted the allocation and used the use after free vulnerability to read the freed memory. This leaked a glibc address for me, after which I was able to calculate glibc base. Next, I used tcache poisoning to leak a stack address. First, I allocated 2 spaces in memory and deleted them so that I would have 2 items in fastbins. Then, I read from one of the memory spaces I deleted (using use after free) to get the protected heap address that would give me the start of the heap. I unencrypted the address and got the front of the heap. Next, I overwrote (with the address of environ) the forward pointer of the later deleted fastbin item (using use after free). I could determine what to write as the forward pointer because I could figure out the address of the chunk whose pointer I wanted to overwrite (due to me having the start of the heap). Using this information, I could give an encrypted forward pointer. After that, I reallocated items so that both fastbin items were used and read the last item I reallocated. In this item, whatever is at environâ€™s address is printed. Thus, I was able to leak a stack address. From this stack address, I could figure out where rip would be. Finally, I can use tcache poisoning once again to write at the address of rip. Since I can write at rip, this means I can use ROP gadgets to spawn a shell. Thus, this challenge was completed.</p>
